<h2><li></h2>
When is acceptable to use floating-point numbers, and when not, do a practical example.<br>
So, if I have to store / perform any kind of processing on a number like 12345.1234567890123456 what do I have to do ?
<h2><li></h2>
With which style do you like to format code ?
<h2><li></h2>
Write a code to generate a certain amount of random numbers, and than check if the average is the expected.
<h2><li></h2>
Write a program that prints the numbers from -712 to 7.<br>
But for multiples of 4 print "X" instead of the number and for the multiples of 5 print "Y". For numbers which are multiples of both 4 and 5 print "Z"<br>
Please note :<br>
If you know how to use Javascript please change the range from 9007199254741001 to 9007199254741254.<br>

<h2><li></h2>
